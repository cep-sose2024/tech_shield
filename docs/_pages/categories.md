## Usage

The Crypto Layer provides a comprehensive set of interfaces and enums for working with cryptographic operations and algorithms. Here's a brief overview of the main components:

### Encryption Algorithms

The `encryption` module defines enums for various encryption algorithms, including:

- `AsymmetricEncryption`: Represents asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA and ECC.
- `BlockCiphers`: Represents symmetric block cipher algorithms like AES, Triple DES, DES, RC2, and Camellia.
- `StreamCiphers`: Represents stream cipher algorithms like RC4 and ChaCha20.

### Hashing Algorithms

The `hashes` module defines the `Hash` enum, which represents various hashing algorithms like SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, MD2, MD4, MD5, and RIPEMD-160.

### Key Management

The `key_handle` module provides the `KeyHandle` trait, which defines a common interface for cryptographic key operations like signing, decryption, encryption, and signature verification. The `GenericKeyHandle` enum represents a platform-agnostic key handle that can be used on both Linux and Windows platforms.

### Security Module Integration

The `module_provider` module defines the `Provider` trait, which encapsulates operations related to cryptographic processing and key management. This trait is designed to be implemented by security modules, ensuring a unified approach to interacting with different types of security modules.

The `factory` module provides the `SecModules` struct, which serves as a namespace for managing and accessing security module instances. It includes methods for retrieving or creating instances of security modules based on their type (HSM or TPM).

### Error Handling

The `error` module defines the `SecurityModuleError` enum, which represents various types of errors that can occur within a security module, including errors originating from HSMs, TPMs, or during cryptographic operations like signing, decryption, encryption, and signature verification.

### Usage Examples

Here are some usage examples based on the Windows TPM handler implementation:

#### Creating a TPM Provider

```rust
use crypto_layer::factory::{SecModules, SecurityModule};
use crypto_layer::tpm::core::instance::TpmType;

let key_id = "my_key_id".to_string();
let tpm_provider = SecModules::get_instances(key_id, SecurityModule::Tpm(TpmType::default()))
    .expect("Failed to create TPM provider");
```

#### Initializing the TPM Module

```rust
use crypto_layer::common::error::SecurityModuleError;

match tpm_provider.lock().unwrap().initialize_module() {
    Ok(()) => println!("TPM module initialized successfully"),
    Err(e) => println!("Failed to initialize TPM module: {:?}", e),
}
```

#### Creating a Key

```rust
use crypto_layer::common::crypto::algorithms::{
    encryption::{AsymmetricEncryption, BlockCiphers},
    hashes::Hash,
};
use crypto_layer::common::KeyUsage;

let key_algorithm = AsymmetricEncryption::Ecc(EccSchemeAlgorithm::EcDsa(EccCurves::P256));
let sym_algorithm = Some(BlockCiphers::Aes(SymmetricMode::Cbc, KeyBits::Bits256));
let hash = Some(Hash::Sha2(Sha2Bits::Sha256));
let key_usages = vec![KeyUsage::SignEncrypt, KeyUsage::Decrypt];

match tpm_provider.lock().unwrap().create_key(
    "my_key_id",
    key_algorithm,
    sym_algorithm,
    hash,
    key_usages,
) {
    Ok(()) => println!("Key created successfully"),
    Err(e) => println!("Failed to create key: {:?}", e),
}
```

#### Signing Data

```rust
let data = b"Hello, world!";

match tpm_provider.lock().unwrap().sign_data(data) {
    Ok(signature) => println!("Signature: {:?}", signature),
    Err(e) => println!("Failed to sign data: {:?}", e),
}
```

#### Verifying Signature

```rust
let data = b"Hello, world!";
let signature = // ... obtained signature ...

match tpm_provider.lock().unwrap().verify_signature(data, &signature) {
    Ok(valid) => {
        if valid {
            println!("Signature is valid");
        } else {
            println!("Signature is invalid");
        }
    }
    Err(e) => println!("Failed to verify signature: {:?}", e),
}
```

These examples demonstrate how to use the Windows TPM handler implementation to perform various cryptographic operations using the Crypto Layer.

## Encryption Algorithms
OpenPGP (Open Pretty Good Privacy)

Overview:
OpenPGP is an open standard for the encryption and signing of emails and files, based on asymmetric cryptography. It uses a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key.

Functionality:

Encryption:

The public key of the recipient is used to encrypt the message or file.
Only the recipient can decrypt the message using their private key.
Signing:

The sender's private key is used to digitally sign the message or file.
The recipient can verify the sender's identity and ensure that the message has not been altered.
Advantages of OpenPGP:

Transparency: The open-source nature increases trust in the technology and security, as the code is auditable.
Versatility: It can be used for encrypting emails, files, and storage devices, and is compatible with many platforms.
Long-Term Use: OpenPGP keys can be used for many years.
Cost-Free: No license fees are required.
Disadvantages of OpenPGP:

Complexity: Setup and usage can be complicated.
Compatibility: Not all email clients and file archivers support OpenPGP.
User-Friendliness: OpenPGP programs are often not very user-friendly.
Cryptographic Algorithms:

RSA:

RSA is not preferred due to its security but inefficiency in key generation.
AES-256:

Symmetric encryption algorithm.
With 256-bit encryption, it is nearly impossible to guess the key.
More efficient than ECC-256 due to being symmetric.
Requires prior asymmetric encryption to securely transmit the key.
ECC-256:

Asymmetric encryption algorithm.
Very secure due to the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP).
Security depends on the choice of an appropriate elliptic curve.
More computationally intensive than AES due to the generation of two keys and more complex mathematical operations.
Transport Layer Security (TLS):
TLS is a protocol for encrypting connections at the transport layer, which can be used to secure the connection itself, while OpenPGP encrypts the data within that connection.

Key Storage Security:

HSM (Hardware Security Module): Keys are stored within the cryptographic boundary of the HSM and are only used for cryptographic operations.
Applications like OpenPGP on a YubiKey do not have direct access to private keys; they can only request the cryptographic processor to perform an operation using one of the protected keys (e.g., "please sign this hash using the private key with key handle N").
In summary, both TLS and OpenPGP can be used to implement different layers of security, with TLS securing the connection and OpenPGP protecting the data itself.
