### wrapper for USB-dongle-devices (yubikeys/nitrokeys)
 
## Overview:

This GitHub project is maintained by TechShield and serves as a wrapper for the proposed crypto abstraction layer, facilitating access to a specific hardware security module (HSM) on attached USB-dongles. These dongles support secure key storage.

## Objective:

Our goal is to provice a user-friendly and secure way to access the functionality of the HSM without needing to worry about complex implementation details. The wrapper aims to simplify the use of the HSM for developers and provice a reliable abstraction layer.

## Features:

- Enables access to the HSM through a user-friendly abstraction layer.
- Supports secure storage and retrieval of keys.
- Provides functions for data encryption and decryption.
- Implements security mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data.

## Usage:

(under construction)
